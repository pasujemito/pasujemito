Hi, I'm Damian! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Platforms Engineer (& Certified Solutions Architect) at Iceland Digital, focusing on AWS, Next.js, and Vercel to build effective digital solutions. With over 7 years of development experience under my belt, I've honed my skills in creating secure, scalable and efficient applications.

In addition to my technical role, I take pride in mentoring junior developers, guiding them as they develop into skilled professionals.
I'm the creator of the Chrome extension "AWS Hero," designed - out of pure flustration - to enhance productivity, usability and help users navigate cloud environments more effectively.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about camping, wild cooking, and exploring the great outdoors. If youâ€™re into technology or nature adventures, let's connect!
